# **DSA-JAVA**

Welcome to my repository of daily Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice codes implemented in Java. This repository serves as a log of my progress and learning journey, covering a wide range of topics from basic to advanced DSA concepts.

## **Contents**
The repository includes implementations and exercises related to the following topics:
####  Arrays: Fundamental operations and manipulations.
#### Linked Lists: Single and doubly linked list implementations.
#### Stacks: Last In, First Out (LIFO) data structure operations.
#### Queues: First In, First Out (FIFO) data structure operations.
#### Trees: Binary trees, binary search trees, and tree traversal techniques.
#### Graphs: Graph representation, traversal algorithms (DFS, BFS), and shortest path algorithms.
#### Sorting Algorithms: Common sorting techniques such as Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and Bubble Sort.
#### Dynamic Programming: Solutions to problems using dynamic programming approaches.
#### And More: Additional DSA topics and challenges.
## **Purpose**
This repository is designed not only as a personal reference but also as a resource for others who are learning or reviewing Data Structures and Algorithms in Java. Contributions, suggestions, and collaborations are welcome!
